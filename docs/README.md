# Documentation
We wanted to provide as much documentation as we could to help make Autessa be as seamless to use as possible.

Of course, like all documentation, it's hard to think of what to write from a newcomer's perspective, so *please*, feel free to let us know if you have any questions about anything, and we will get back to you. The bot is right there in the lower right corner :blush:

If there are changes you would also just like to make, we do have the documentation available as [open source](https://github.com/Autessa-Inc/AutessaPublicDocumentation) to update using a pull request. There is no pressure to do it, but if something is really bugging you, just go for it!
