**I want to get inputs from the user in my AutessaScript. How can I do that?**
We are currently working on this feature to make it easier to accept user input in a bot conversation! However, we do support HTML for creating forms, iframes, and google forms in the meantime for getting information from users. Stay tuned for early 2024!

**There's functionality I want in the script that is not currently supported.**
Please contact us! We'd love to hear from you and add new features that our customers are looking for :)
