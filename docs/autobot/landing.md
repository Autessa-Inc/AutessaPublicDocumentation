# Autobot <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->
Use autobot to generate a custom chatbot for your webapp, or anywhere HTML can go!

Autobot is focused on converting user sentences into finding their **intentions**, and then you can create flows for these intentions. You have the power to define what users are likely to ask, and define exactly how you would want your bot to respond. With access to powerful generative AI models, you can have the bot respond as human-like as possible, based on the user context.

If you're still not sure what users ask, Autobot supports having a fallback to send an email to your customer service inbox to generate a ticket to continue supporting the customer. Beyond that, customer history is tracked in our [history dashboard](autobot/inner/history.md), giving you the full ability to analyze *how* customers are interacting with your bot so you can improve the experience. We support version control on both the intent model and the bot experience, meaning that you never need to worry about changes affecting your customers before you are ready. 

Autobot is powerful enough where you can write custom code using [AutessaScript](autobot/inner/autessa_script.md), an extension of JavaScript, but we offer many powerful built-in templates to help you create custom flows with ease.
