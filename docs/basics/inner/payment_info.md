# Adding Payment Information

Autessa requires valid payment information to be on file in order to have access to our paid features. We have to keep the lights on :weary:

## Adding Card Information
Currently, Autessa only supports paying by card, but we are working to support more payment types. 

In order to add a new card:
1. Log into the suite (https://suite.autessa.com)
2. In the left sidebar, head over to Payment Center
3. Click "Add Card" in the header
4. Fill out the necessary information and hit save

*Trouble saving your card information? Feel free to reach out with the bot in the lower left on suite to contact support, or through our contact us page or bot in the lower right!*

### Marking Card as Default
Whenever you add a new card to your account, it is made to be your default payment method. If you would like to set another card as your default payment method, simply click "mark card as default" on the payment page.

## Billing
We charge your card at the start of the next month for your previous month's bill (ex. you will be charged on Nov 2 for your October bill). Before we charge, we will email a breakdown of the bill. We always provide a detailed breakdown on the suite payment center dashboard -- if you are confused for your month's usage, we recommend checking out the breakdown. 

If you are confused on why usage for a particular service might have been higher than you expected, do not hestiate to contact us. 

When we autocharge, we start with the default card, but if that fails, we will attempt the charge the rest of the cards you have on file. If we are still unable to charge, your account will be marked as having invalid payment information. We will send you an email if this is the case with a link in order for you to pay your bill. After 30 days, paid services will be blocked (service dependent) until a payment has been made. When you make a payment, we will save the card on file to be used for future charges. 

## Geographic Restrictions
We're currently registered to sell software in the US, so we have restricted accepting credit card information outside of the US. Tax law is hard :) However, if you wanted to use our services, please contact us! We'll rush the process to be registered in your country, and see what we can do to help you have availability as soon as possible. 

Our free services are available for use worldwide.
